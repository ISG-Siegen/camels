# CaMeLS: Cooperative Meta-Learning Service for Recommender Systems

---

Usage:
1. Configuration
   1. Install the requirements or build the Docker container. 
   2. Optional: Configure the database with the database_identifier file. 
2. Run server.py with Flask.
3. Change the server-ip connection_settings.
4. Call functions in client.py. Supply parameters if necessary. There are examples in client.py.
   1. `c_populate_database()` to fill the database with basic tables and information.
   2. `c_evaluate_algorithms()` to upload data sets and evaluation scores.
   3. `c_train_meta_learner()` to manually train a selected meta-learner.
   4. `c_predict_with_meta_learner()` to predict the best algorithm using the meta-learner.
5. To distribute for clients, package the client folder with your database_identifier.py.
